🔐 SecureWay – Pathfinder

SecureWay Pathfinder is an intelligent system designed to provide safe and optimized navigation routes by combining pathfinding algorithms with security-focused heuristics.
It ensures that users not only reach their destination efficiently but also with enhanced safety, reliability, and real-time adaptability.

🚀 Features

🗺️ Pathfinding Algorithms – Uses Dijkstra / A* / BFS for optimal routes

🔐 Security-Aware Navigation – Avoids unsafe or restricted areas

⚡ Real-time Updates – Dynamic route recalculations based on conditions

📊 Visualization – Interactive map & path visualization

🌍 Scalable – Can adapt for logistics, autonomous vehicles, or urban safety

🏗️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React / TypeScript / Vite (for visualization)

Backend: Node.js / Express (API & route computations)

Algorithms: A*, Dijkstra, BFS/DFS

Database (optional): MongoDB / PostgreSQL (for storing maps, checkpoints, user data)

Security Layer: Custom heuristics for path safety
